# Figures

Visual companions to [`paper_draft.md`](../docs/paper/paper_draft.md) and
[`report.md`](../docs/paper/report.md). Each figure is self-contained and
references the corresponding paper sections.

| # | File | Format | What it shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`01_experimental_arc.md`](01_experimental_arc.md) | Mermaid (renders on GitHub) | The pre-register → falsify → revise → re-test timeline with commit hashes and gap numbers inline |
| 2 | [`02_results_matrix.md`](02_results_matrix.md) | Markdown heatmap | Cross-domain × feature × condition outcome matrix with color-coded verdicts, including July 4 HTTP carry-through follow-ups |
| 3 | [`03_per_layer_ablation.png`](03_per_layer_ablation.png) | PNG (matplotlib) | Where each (domain, feature) representation lives across transformer depth |
| 4 | [`04_cross_condition_gradient.png`](04_cross_condition_gradient.png) | PNG (matplotlib) | Real / within-shuffled / global-shuffled gap comparison; shows where the monotonicity prediction holds and where it does not |
| 5 | [`05_maze_shuffle_comparison.png`](05_maze_shuffle_comparison.png) | PNG (matplotlib) | Maze-only real / within-shuffled / global-shuffled comparison |
| 6 | [`06_http_shuffle_comparison.png`](06_http_shuffle_comparison.png) | PNG (matplotlib) | HTTP-only real / within-shuffled / global-shuffled comparison |

The matplotlib figures are regeneratable from the source scripts:

```bash
python figures/03_per_layer_ablation.py
python figures/04_cross_condition_gradient.py
python figures/05_maze_http_shuffle_comparison.py
```
